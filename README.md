# Random-Python
The things I do when I am bored in python, they can be really basic projects or can be interesting you better take a look.
-------------------
exchange.py ==> it is an live currency convertor console based app, additionaly at the end of your search you can check for live stock market prices, if you want to convert some money from USD to anything you want (JPY = for Japan currency et.) just type the short form of the currency (3 letters). Then at the end app will ask you if you want to continue or not for stock market search, you just need to do the same thing as you did before and put the code of the stock you are looking for (example: TSLA for Tesla).
-----------------
timecount.py ==> it is a simple app that basically shows the time, I used it during studying my lectures to track the time more accurate and in bigger form, mostly used it during highschool.
